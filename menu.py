# menu containing console commands for an input-based web scraper

some commands I want to implement:
    - 'b': list top 10 highest ranking books
        --> format: Title by Author (Rating) - $Price
    - 'c': list top 5 cheapest books
    - 'b <genre>': list top 5 books in a specific genre
    - 'n': list next book in SOMETHING // to be defined
        --> gives one book at a time, user can keep typing 'n' to see next book
    - 'q': quit the program
